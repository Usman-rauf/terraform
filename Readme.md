1. Configure Variables
Edit the variables.tf files in the root and each module to match your environment. You can also create a terraform.tfvars file in the root directory to specify variable values globally.

Example terraform.tfvars:

hcl
Copy code
aws_region       = "us-east-1"
vpc_id           = "vpc-123456"
security_groups  = ["sg-123456"]
subnets          = ["subnet-123456", "subnet-654321"]
db_username      = "your-db-username"
db_password      = "your-db-password"
3. Initialize Terraform
Initialize the project to download required provider plugins and modules.

bash
Copy code
terraform init
4. Review and Plan the Deployment
Run terraform plan to review the resources that will be created.

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
5. Deploy the Infrastructure
Apply the changes to create the resources in your AWS account.

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
